<h1>Helios</h1>
Helios Wearable Haptic Device
Helios is a wearable haptic device designed to assist visually impaired individuals in sensing, recognizing, and securing objects within their surroundings. This project leverages natural language processing, computer vision, and haptic feedback techniques to create a closed circuit system situated on the user's wrist.

Key Features
Object Sensing: Helios utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect objects in the user's environment.
Object Recognition: The system employs AI techniques to recognize objects by comparing them against a pre-stored database.
Localization and Direction: Haptic feedback in the form of buzzers on the user's wrist guides their hand toward the desired object.
Speech Interaction: The device includes a microphone for capturing user speech, which is processed using speech recognition technology.
Text-to-Speech Output: Helios converts object information into speech output for the user.
Getting Started
To get started with Helios, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/helios.git
Install the necessary dependencies (provide a list of required libraries and versions).
Set up the hardware components, including the Raspberry Pi, microphone, and buzzers.
Configure the database of stored objects.
Run the main program file to start the Helios system.
System Requirements
Raspberry Pi (provide the required specifications, if any)
Microphone
Buzzers or haptic feedback components
Computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV)
Speech recognition library (e.g., SpeechRecognition)
Text-to-speech library (e.g., pyttsx3)
Usage
Power on the Raspberry Pi and ensure that all hardware components are properly connected.
Launch the main program file (provide the name of the file).
Speak into the microphone to communicate with the Helios system.
The system will recognize your speech, search for the desired object in the database, and provide haptic feedback to guide your hand toward the object.
Haptic buzzers will indicate the direction (left, right, forward) in which to move your hand.
The system will convert object information into speech output, which will be played through the speakers or headphones.
